# MarkdownTab_Chrome Extension
### A *Markdown* page that comes up __everytime__ we open a new tab

Useful for taking notes, keeping lists, saving links, or to be reminded of pictures or quotes.

John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created the Markdown language in 2004. Its key design goal is readability. That the language be readable as-is, without looking like it has been marked up with tags or formatting instructions, unlike text formatted with a markup language, such as Rich Text Format (RTF) or HTML, which have obvious tags and formatting instructions.
